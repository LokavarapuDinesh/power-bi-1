Data Integration: Customized a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze Telangana Tourism's performance and visitor trends by consolidating data from multiple sources, including government databases, tourism reports, and website analytics. This ensured a holistic view of tourism-related data.

Efficient Data Model: Designed and implemented a robust data model within Power BI to facilitate efficient data processing and analysis. This design allowed for quick insights into tourism trends, helping Telangana Tourism make informed decisions.

Optimization with DAX: Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Studio to optimize the Power BI report, resulting in a significant 5% improvement in report performance. This optimization enhanced the speed of data retrieval and analysis, making the dashboard more responsive.

Interactive Visualizations: Created a diverse set of dynamic and interactive visualizations within Power BI. These visualizations showcased key tourism metrics, such as visitor arrivals, popular destinations, and seasonal trends, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and explore the data.

Revenue Projection: Leveraging insights gained from the Power BI dashboard, Telangana Tourism projected a substantial 10% increase in revenue. This projection was made possible by strategically targeting high-demand tourist destinations and optimizing promotional efforts based on the data-driven insights.

I worked on this project likely played a crucial role in enhancing Telangana Tourism's ability to manage and promote tourism effectively, ultimately leading to improved revenue and visitor experiences.
